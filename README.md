# Arduino-Uno-Based-Load-Cell-

How It Works:
Load Cell: The load cell converts the force (weight) applied to it into a small electrical signal. The magnitude of this signal is proportional to the weight.

HX711 Amplifier: The HX711 amplifies the small signal from the load cell and converts it into a digital signal that the Arduino can read.

Arduino Uno: The Arduino reads the digital signal from the HX711 and converts it into a weight value, which is then displayed in the Serial Monitor.

Calibration:
The provided code reads the raw data from the HX711. To get accurate weight readings, you need to calibrate the scale. You can do this by applying a known weight to the load cell and adjusting the scale factor in the code using scale.set_scale(scale_factor); to match the known weight.

Calibration involves trial and error, adjusting the scale factor until the reading matches the known weight.

Applications:
Weighing Scales: Use load cells with HX711 and Arduino to build electronic weighing scales.
Force Measurement: Measure force in various mechanical systems.
Material Testing: Determine the weight of materials or objects in research and development environments.
